This is a collection of quotes I have been curating since 1989.

Everything in this file is in the public domain to the best of my knowledge,
and the contents have been edited to my personal tastes.  I have tried to 
eliminate anything really offensive and would consider the contents generally
SFW.

The file is strictly ASCII and consists of quotes formatted to fit in 80
columns separated by '%' on a line by itself.

There are still a lot of duplicates, a lot of poorly formatted quotes and 
other weird things.  I perform a little bit of clean-up every once in a
while, and add stuff when I find something interesting.
