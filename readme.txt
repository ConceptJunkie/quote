Quite simply, this is a collection of quotes I have been curating since 1989.

Everything in this file is in the public domain to the best of my knowledge,
and the contents have been edited to my personal tastes.

The file is strictly ASCII and consists of quotes formatted to fit in 80
columns separated by '%' on a line by itself.

There are still a lot of duplicates in here, and possibly the occasional
weird character, and you will also find the word 'goobles' in a few places,
which is a bookmark that denotes the progress of a particular clean up
operation.
