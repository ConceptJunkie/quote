This is quote database I've been curating since 1989.

Everything in here is, to my best knowledge, in the public domain.

It has been edited to suit my tastes and interests, and I have made a serious
effort to keep it family-friendly, although I can make no guarantees, given
that there are over 100,000 quotes in here.

There are also a lot of duplicates, and I have been making an effort to
eliminate those (more than 40,000 in the last year or so), but have not yet
attempted to automate that process.

The file format is very simple and similar to 'fortune'.  The quotes are ASCII
text, wrapped to fit in 80 columns and each quote is separated by a single
percent sign on a line.  Python code to index and display quotes is included.

Donations of more material are welcome.
